<p>The root node is represented by a <b>HIERARCHYID</b>
structure.</p>

<p><b>Example 1</b></p>

<p>The first child of the root node, with a logical
representation of /1/, is represented as the following bit sequence:</p>

<p>01011000</p>

<p>The first two bits, 01, are the L1 field, meaning that the
first node has a label between 0 (zero) and 3. The next two bits, 01, are the
O1 field and are interpreted as the integer 1. Adding this to the beginning of
the range specified by the L1 yields 1. The next bit, with the value 1, is the
F1 field, which means that this is a &quot;real&quot; level, with 1 followed by
a slash in the logical representation. The final three bits, 000, are the W
field, padding the representation to the nearest byte.</p>

<p><b>Example 2</b></p>

<p>As a more complicated example, the node with logical
representation /1/-2.18/ (the child with label -2.18 of the child with label 1
of the root node) is represented as the following sequence of bits (a space has
been inserted after every grouping of 8 bits to make the sequence easier to
follow):</p>

<p>01011001 11111011 00000101 01000000</p>

<p>The first three fields are the same as in the first example.
That is, the first two bits (01) are the L1 field, the second two bits (01) are
the O1 field, and the fifth bit (1) is the F1 field. This encodes the /1/
portion of the logical representation.</p>

<p>The next 5 bits (00111) are the L2 field, so the next
integer is between -8 and -1. The following 3 bits (111) are the O2 field,
representing the offset 7 from the beginning of this range. Thus, the L2 and O2
fields together encode the integer -1. The next bit (0) is the F2 field.
Because it is 0 (zero), this level is fake, and 1 has to be subtracted from the
integer yielded by the L2 and O2 fields. Therefore, the L2, O2, and F2 fields
together represent -2 in the logical representation of this node.</p>

<p>The next 3 bits (110) are the L3 field, so the next integer
is between 16 and 79. The subsequent 8 bits (00001010) are the L4 field.
Removing the anti-ambiguity bits from there (the third bit (0) and the fifth
bit (1)) leaves 000010, which is the binary representation of 2. Thus, the
integer encoded by the L3 and O3 fields is 16+2, which is 18. The next bit (1)
is the F3 field, representing the slash (/) after the 18 in the logical
representation. The final 6 bits (000000) are the W field, padding the physical
representation to the nearest byte.</p>
