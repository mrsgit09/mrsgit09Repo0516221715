<p><b>Connect Timeout</b>: This timer is used during
establishment of the session. After establishing a network connection, the
Connect Timeout value is used as a timeout value for each network send and
receive operation, during the Authentication and Handshake messages in the
login sequence. Note that the user perception of connecting includes many
network messages, so the usage might not match the user expectations in some
situations.<a id="Appendix_A_Target_11"></a><a href="05c9e5c4-4566-418c-a56e-69fca8d73f4b.html#Appendix_A_11" aria-label="Product behavior note 11">&lt;11&gt;</a></p>

<p><b>Query Timeout</b>: This timer is used during query
request and response. The query timeout is applied to user queries, which can
result in none or many request /response pairs. Thus it MUST be applied in the
client application layer. For each request the client makes it MUST set the
network timeout for the network receive operation. A client observing a network
timeout error MUST close the network connection, return an error to the calling
application, and later MUST reconnect. Note that the network cannot be used
until a response has been completed. The default query timeout value is 60
minutes. The query timeout can be set on the OLE DB connection string or
programmatically set for each query.</p>

<p><b>Ping Period</b>: This is an optional background
timer used by the client to check for changes on the server. Often user queries
are answered from cached data without communication to the server. This
mechanism allows limiting the time lag between possible server data updates and
user visibility of those changes. Note that all request/response pairs are
serialized on a single connection; therefore it is possible for a user request
to occur when a background ping refresh request is in progress, and therefore
needs to wait for completion. By default the ping period is 10 seconds. The
ping period can be set on the OLE DB connection string, with a minimum of 250
ms.</p>
