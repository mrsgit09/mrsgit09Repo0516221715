<p>This section specifies common steps that MUST be performed
whenever the client receives the response to a request that it has sent.</p>

<p>The client MUST associate the response with the request
sent. The client MUST only send one request at a time. Multiplexing of multiple
requests is not supported, and intermixing more than one request would result
in nonsensical stream of bytes (octets) observed by the server.</p>

<p>The client SHOULD<a id="Appendix_A_Target_24"></a><a href="05c9e5c4-4566-418c-a56e-69fca8d73f4b.html#Appendix_A_24" aria-label="Product behavior note 24">&lt;24&gt;</a> implement
its own timeout mechanism, for the case of the server not responding within the
specified connection timeout or query timeout. Note that if a response to a
first request has not been received, it will not be possible to send a second
request. In this case, it MAY be necessary to close the connection and
establish a new connection.</p>

<p>The client MUST check the status code in the response to
determine if the request succeeded. The sections dealing with responses for
specified request types can have rules for how to handle certain failed
requests, and any such rules MUST be followed. Errors SHOULD<a id="Appendix_A_Target_25"></a><a href="05c9e5c4-4566-418c-a56e-69fca8d73f4b.html#Appendix_A_25" aria-label="Product behavior note 25">&lt;25&gt;</a> be propagated to the higher
level application.</p>

<p>The client MUST check the status code for PN_REFRESH. This
indicates the server version is different from the client version. The response
might not include all the information requested, depending on which request it
is, as specified in section <a href="8d2c5acb-eb98-477b-9fe2-c934b19fb018.html">2</a>.
For some application scenarios server updates will be done with high frequency
and it is vital that updates be handled correctly. Note that a single user
request can result in 0 or many server request/response pairs, so to ensure
consistency of the answer to the user, the client SHOULD restart the user
request.</p>
