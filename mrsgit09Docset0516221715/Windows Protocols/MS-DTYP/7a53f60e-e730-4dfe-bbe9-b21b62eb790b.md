<p>An ACCESS_MASK is a 32-bit set of flags that are used to
encode the user rights to an object. An access mask is used both to encode the
rights to an object assigned to a principal and to encode the requested access
when opening an object.</p>

<p>The bits with an X value in the table below are used for
object-specific user rights. A file object would encode, for example, Read
Access and Write Access. A registry key object would encode Create Subkey and
Read Value, for example.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>  The bits with a value of X are
reserved for use by specific protocols that make use of the ACCESS_MASK data
type. The nature of this usage differs according to each protocol and is implementation-specific.</p>

<p>The bits in positions 0 through 3 in the following table are
generic rights that can be mapped to object-specific user rights by the <a href="a66edeb1-52a0-4d64-a93b-2f5c833d7d92.md#gt_a7d0361f-8608-454d-9a52-67d4d181ae09">resource manager</a> for the
requested object. The mapping of these rights is implementation-specific.</p>

<p>The bits with an R value in the table below are reserved.</p>

<p>The bits in positions 6 and 7 are for maximum allowed and
access system security rights.</p>

<p>The bits in positions 11 through 15 are standard rights that
are common to all objects.</p>

<p>If the <b>GR</b>/<b>GW</b>/<b>GX</b>/<b>GA</b> bits are set
in an <a href="d06e5a81-176e-46c6-9cf7-9137aad4455e.md">ACE</a> structure
that is already attached to an object, requesting access might produce
unintended results. This is because the Access Check algorithm does not map
generic rights to object-specific rights for ACE structures. This mapping is
only made for the requested ACCESS_MASK passed as a parameter to the Access
Check algorithm, as specified in section <a href="4f1bbcbb-814a-4c70-a11e-2a5b8779a6f9.md">2.5.3.2</a>.</p>
