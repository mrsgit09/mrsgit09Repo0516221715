<p>The immutable nature of the NDB means that any data that is
modified from time to time is constantly being moved around in the file,
because each modification requires a new allocation in the file. This also
means that, as data is edited, small pockets of free space are created
throughout the file when the original copy of the data is removed.</p>

<p>The allocation algorithm used by the NDB is very efficient
in repurposing the small pockets of free space created when a block is edited.
However this algorithm makes no attempt to keep related data together because
the overall goal is to use space within the file as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>The end result of this is that any NDB which is not
completely static is very prone to internal fragmentation as edits are made.
This is especially true of larger streams of data because they are comprised of
many blocks, some of which are touched by edits and others of which are not.
Those blocks touched by an edit move and those that aren't remain where they
are, leading to more and more fragmentation as the different parts of the
stream are edited at different times.</p>

<p>This tendency of a PST to fragment internally naturally
lends to low locality of reference which means highly scattered read/write
patterns. It is recommended that implementations design an access mechanism
that minimizes the performance impact of fragmented data access.</p>
