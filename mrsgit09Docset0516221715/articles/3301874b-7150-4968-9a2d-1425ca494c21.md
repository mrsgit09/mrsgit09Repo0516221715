<p>To improve storage efficiency, the NDB supports
single-instancing by allowing multiple entities to reference the same data
block. This is supported at the BBT level by having reference counts for
blocks.</p>

<p>For example, when a node is copied, a new node is created
with a new NID, but instead of making a separate copy of the entire contents of
the node, the new node simply references the existing immediate data and
subnode blocks by incrementing the reference count of each block.</p>

<p>The single-instance is only broken when the data referenced
needs to be changed by a referencing node. This requires creation of a new
block into which the new data is written and the reference count to the
original block is decremented. When the reference count of a block reaches one,
then the block is no longer use in use and is marked as &quot;Free&quot; in the
corresponding AMap. Finally, the corresponding leaf BBT entry is removed from
the BBT.</p>

<p>In addition to the BBTENTRY, other types of structures can
also hold references to a block. The following is a list of structures that can
hold reference counts to a block:</p>

<p><span>ยง<span>  </span></span><b>Leaf BBTENTRY:</b>
Any leaf BBT entry that points to a BID holds a reference count to it.</p>

<p><span>ยง<span>  </span></span><b>NBTENTRY:</b> A
reference count is held if a block is referenced in the <b>bidData</b> or <b>bidSub</b>
fields of a NBTENTRY.</p>

<p><span>ยง<span>  </span></span><b>SLBLOCK:</b> a
reference count is held if a block is referenced in the <b>bidData</b> or <b>bidSub</b>
fields of an SLENTRY.</p>

<p><span>ยง<span>  </span></span><b>Data tree:</b> A
reference count is held if a block is referenced in an <b>rgbid</b> slot of an
XBLOCK.</p>

<p>For example, consider a node called &quot;Node1&quot;. The
data block of Node1 has a reference count of 2 (BBTENTRY and Node1's NBTENTRY.<b>bidData</b>).
If a copy of Node1 is made (Node2), then the block's reference count becomes 3
(Node2's NBTENTRY.<b>bidData</b>). If a change is made to Node2's data, then a
new data block is created for the modified copy with a reference count of 2
(BBTENTRY, Node2's NBTENTRY.<b>bidData</b>), and the reference count of Node1's
data block returns to 2 (BBTENTRY, Node1's NBTENTRY.<b>bidData</b>).</p>
