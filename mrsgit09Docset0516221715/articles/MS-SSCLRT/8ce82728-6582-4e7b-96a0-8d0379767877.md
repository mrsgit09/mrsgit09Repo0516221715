<p>The <b>GEOGRAPHY</b> and <b>GEOMETRY</b> structures are
serialized by using the binary format described later in this section. Each
structure contains several fixed fields (or header fields) and building
elements<a id="Appendix_A_Target_2"></a><a href="236596a7-5eb5-4451-8f40-a2aa1c8afea9.htm#Appendix_A_2" aria-label="Product behavior note 2">&lt;2&gt;</a> that are repeated, as necessary,
to describe the geography fully.</p>

<p>The <b>GEOGRAPHY POINT</b> and <b>GEOMETRY POINT</b>
structures contain the coordinates for an individual point and are repeated for
as many points as are present in the <b>GEOGRAPHY</b> or <b>GEOMETRY</b>
structure. One shape structure appears for each OGC simple feature that is contained
in the <b>GEOGRAPHY</b> or <b>GEOMETRY</b> structure. A shape can consist of
multiple figures, each of which is defined by a single figure structure. The <b>GEOGRAPHY</b>
and <b>GEOMETRY</b> structures contain flags and counts that indicate how many
of these building elements are contained in the <b>GEOGRAPHY</b> and <b>GEOMETRY</b>
structures.</p>

<p>The structures that are used to transfer <b>geography</b>
and <b>geometry</b> data types are identical. Therefore, in the remainder of
this document, the term &quot;<b>GEOGRAPHY</b> structure&quot; refers to both
the <b>GEOGRAPHY</b> and <b>GEOMETRY</b> structures, except where it is
necessary to distinguish between the two structures. Likewise, &quot;<b>geography</b>
data type&quot; refers to both the <b>geography</b> and <b>geometry</b> protocol
server data types.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>  The term &quot;<b>GEOGRAPHY POINT</b>
structure&quot; does not also refer to the <b>GEOMETRY POINT</b> structure in
this document.</p>
